**Mini-Project: MPI-Based Distributed Matrix Multiplication
**
**Project Title: Distributed Matrix Multiplication using MPI
**

Objective: To implement and evaluate the performance of matrix multiplication across
multiple nodes using MPI.
Tasks:
Environment Setup: Set up an MPI development environment.
Matrix Multiplication: Implement a standard matrix multiplication algorithm.
Distributed Implementation: Modify the algorithm for distributed computation using
MPI, focusing on data partitioning and inter-process communication.
Performance Metrics: Develop a system to measure execution time and scalability.
Scalability Testing: Test the algorithm on different numbers of nodes/processes.
Benchmarking: Benchmark against a serial implementation to evaluate performance
gains.
Deliverables: MPI-based distributed matrix multiplication code, performance metrics,
benchmarking report, and detailed documentation.
